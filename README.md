- Investigate the reasons behind the 2020 revenue decline and implement strategies to mitigate future risks, such as supply chain flexibility or digital sales channels.
- Capitalize on strong performance in the USA by expanding market effortsâ€”consider region-specific product designs or promotions.
- Explore growth opportunities in high-revenue, low-customer countries like Spain and France by identifying similar high-potential clients.
- Consider bundling or discounting low-performing toys like Trucks, Buses, and Planes to move inventory while increasing their visibility.
- Segment customers by revenue tiers to provide tailored experiences and maximize customer retention across different market levels.

# Conclusion
